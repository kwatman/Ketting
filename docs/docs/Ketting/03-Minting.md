# Minting
Minting is the process of creating a new block. The following section will explain how this is done in Ketting.

## The process

### 1-Gathering data
The first step in the process of minting a block is collecting all the date that will be in the block. In the case of a crypto coin this would be the transactions.

### 2-Verifying data
The data that is put in the block needs to be correct. so first it needs to be verified.

### 3-Fill in necessary information
Put the hash of the previous block in the block. and also put the timestamp and blockchain version number in the block.

### 4-Create hash and encrypt
Put the public key of the validator in the block and create a hash of the block and encrypt it with the validators private key.
